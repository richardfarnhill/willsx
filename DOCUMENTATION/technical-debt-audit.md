# WillsX Technical Debt Audit

## Purpose
This document catalogs specific technical issues in the current implementation to determine whether targeted fixes or a complete rebuild is warranted.

## Issue Categories

### 1. Performance Issues
- Document specific slow page loads or processes
- Identify queries or operations causing bottlenecks
- Note plugin-related performance problems

### 2. Maintainability Problems
- Areas of code with high complexity or poor organization
- Undocumented dependencies or "magic" behavior
- Inconsistent coding patterns

### 3. Integration Pain Points
- Failed or unreliable service connections
- Data synchronization problems
- Authentication/authorization complications

### 4. WordPress Limitations
- Features fighting against WordPress core
- Plugin conflicts and their impacts
- Theme customization roadblocks

### 5. Development Workflow Obstacles
- Version control issues
- Deployment failures
- Local development environment problems

## Issue Impact Assessment

Each issue should be rated:
1. **Severity** (1-5): Impact on user experience or business functionality
2. **Scope** (Isolated/Moderate/Systemic): How widespread the issue is
3. **Fixability** (Easy/Moderate/Complex): Difficulty of addressing within current architecture

## Recommendation Framework

Based on the audit findings:

1. **Proceed with Current Architecture**: If issues are primarily isolated and fixable
2. **Partial Rebuild**: If certain components need replacement while others work well
3. **Complete Rebuild**: If systemic issues affect the foundation of the application

### Rebuild Decision Matrix

| Factor | Continue | Partial Rebuild | Complete Rebuild |
|--------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| % Problematic Code | <30% | 30-70% | >70% |
| Business Impact | Low | Medium | High |
| Timeline Pressure | High | Medium | Low |
| Budget Constraints | Tight | Moderate | Flexible |
| Future Scalability | Limited needs | Moderate growth | Significant expansion |

## Action Items

1. Complete this audit with development team input
2. Quantify time spent on recurring issues
3. Estimate costs of continuing vs. rebuilding
4. Review business priorities and timeline
5. Make final recommendation with supporting data
